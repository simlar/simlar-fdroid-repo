### Our F-Droid Repository

We have our own F-Droid repository to make Simlar available for you.
Please note that due to the removal of GApps, the app has to run permanently in the background so you can be reached via Simlar.

To add the repo to **F-Droid**, just copy this link:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simlar/simlar-fdroid-repo/master/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=EE2C075BAE1D41BBD9C2195C4CAE140C789C9ED2E0D6C6A569108E81F625D049
```

Or simple scan this qrcode with the F-Droid app:
